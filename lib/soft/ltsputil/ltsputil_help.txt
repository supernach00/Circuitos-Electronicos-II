  Conversion between binary raw file and ASCII raw file format.
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  It converts and copies a raw data file to either an ASCII-data file
  or a binary data file.
  Other useful options can add the plot offset to the x-axis and
  swept parameter simulations can be split to single runs stored in
  separate raw files.

  Usage
    Ltsputil.exe -c[o][a|b][z][s] source destination
          Option 'o'   : Overwrite an existing output file.
		  Option 'a|b' : Output data format is 'a'SCII or 'b'inary.
                         If none of these two options is given,
                         output data format is binary.
		  Option 'z'   : Add x-axis offset to x-axis, zero offset.
		  Option 's'   : Write each sweep into a different file.
		                 File name contains the sweep number
		                 Example: out.raw -> out1.raw, out2.raw ...

  Example
	Ltsputil.exe -c mybin.raw myascii.raw
	        Option -c or -cb forces binary output format.

  Example
	Ltsputil.exe -ca myxy.raw mybin.raw
	        Option -ca forces ASCII output format.

  Example
	Ltsputil.exe -cbz myxy.raw mybin.raw
	        Option z means zero offset after it's added to the x-axis.

  Example
	Ltsputil.exe -cbzs myxy.raw mybin.raw
	        Option z means reset offset after it's added to the x-axis.
	        Option b means binary data format.
	        Option s means one file per sweep run in the simulation.




  Equalize stepsize of a LTSpice raw file.
  ----------------------------------------
  This function generates a new LTSpice raw data file with a chosen number
  of data points with equal step size. This can be very helpful with later
  external post processing, e.g. FFT.
  Background information about (LT)Spice:
  You have no control of the really used time steps in .TRAN simulations.
  The only parameter you have there is minimum time step. The more activity
  is on the signals, the smaller becomes the stepsize in .TRAN simulations.
  The equalize function uses either linear or vector interpolation to
  calculate data values in a fixed step size. Vector interpolation is used
  for complex data only(.AC analysis). It has no influence on real data 
  (.TRAN, .DC...). 
  The x-axis starting point and end point can be specified. If the x-axis
  of the equalized step is beyond the simulated x-axis, the first/last
  y-data values are hold in the output file (no extrapolation)
  This behaviour can be sometimes observed in .TRAN simulations where the
  specified stop time is often not exactly reached. It can be avoided by
  specifying a slightly larger stop time as really needed.
  Using a small minimum stepsize in the simulation greatly helps to reduce
  the interpolation errors. 
  I recommend to switch off compression in .TRAN simulations if you 
  intend to merge raw files or if you want to equalize the time steps.
  The compression switch is in the control panel of LTSpice.
  The raw file size can be reduced dramatically with the the .SAVE
  command in LTSpice.

  General usage:
    Ltsputil.exe -e[o][l|v][a|b] source dest stepnum [varext] [xstart xend]
          Option 'o'   : Overwrite an existing output file.
          Option 'l|v' : Use 'l'inear or 'v'ector interpolation.
                         If none of these two options is given,
                         vector interpolation will be used.
                         The 'v' option should be used for .AC analysis.
		  Option 'a'   : Output data format is ASCII.
		                 'b'inary is assumed as default if none is set.
          Optional a variable names extension can be specified.
          Optional a x-axis start and end value can be specified.

  Example: 1001 points, add "" nothing to the variable names.
    Ltsputil.exe -e my.raw myeq.raw 1001 ""
          If you look the new raw file(myeq.raw) in LTSpice,t
          the variables(nodes)have kept their original names.
          Vector interpolation will be used, because -e is the same as -ev.

  Example: 1001 points, add "_e" to the variable names
    Ltsputil.exe -e my.raw myeq.raw 1001 "_e"
          If you look the new raw file(myeq.raw) in LTSpice,
          the variables(nodes) have become new names. V(out)
          now will be V(out_e) in the LTSpice output display.

  Example: 
    Ltsputil.exe -el my.raw myeq.raw 1001 "_e"
          Same as above, but -el forces linear interpolation in .AC analysis
          If no complex data are given, always linear interpolation is used

  Example: 
    Ltsputil.exe -ea my.raw myeq.raw 1001 "_e" 2.5e0 5.5e0
          Node names are extended with "_e".
          Output data file's x-axis is limited from 2.5 to 5.5
          Option -ea forces ASCII data output mode



  Info about a file
  -----------------
  It prints simulation properties of a raw file. The information mainly comes
  from the head lines of the raw file. You can get this information also
  if you open the raw file with a text editor. It is ASCII text.
  The biggest part of the raw files are the variable(node) values which
  are normally in binary format. You can have ASCII data instead when you
  select ASCII in the control panel compression menu. Normally this makes
  no sense, because the file size will be four times increased.

  Usage:
  	Ltsputil.exe -i source

  Example:
    Ltsputil my.raw

         ASCII DATA



  Merge data of two raw files
  ---------------------------
  Merging two raw files allows a direct comparison of two totally different
  circuit simulations in one graphical output window.
  It can be also used to add limit curves.
  The number of simulation steps in each file may be different.
  File size of the output file can be up to twice the sum of both files,
  especially with .TRAN simulations where you never have the same x-axis
  values. The program calculates new variable values for every x-axis
  value from each file. 
  The merge-function uses either linear or vector interpolation to
  calculate data values in a fixed step size. Vector interpolation is used
  for complex data only(.AC analysis). It has no influence on real data 
  (.TRAN, .DC...). 
  Using a small minimum stepsize in the simulation greatly helps to reduce
  the interpolation errors. 
  I recommend to switch off compression in .TRAN simulation if you
  think of merging the generated raw files or if you want to equalize
  the time steps. The compression switch is in the control panel of 
  LTspiceIV/SwitcherCADIII.
  The raw file size can be reduced dramatically with the the .SAVE
  command in LTSpice.

  General usage:
   Ltsputil.exe -m[o][l|v][a|b] source1 source2 destination "ext1" "ext2"
          Option 'o'   : Overwrite an existing output file.
          Option 'l|v' : Use 'l'inear or 'v'ector interpolation.
                         If none of these two options is given,
                         vector interpolation will be used.
                         The 'v' option should be used for .AC analysis.
		  Option 'a'   : Output data format is ASCII.
		                 'b'inary is assumed as default if none is set.

  Example 1: 1001 points, add ""(=nothing) to the variable names
     Ltsputil.exe -m in1.raw in2.raw out.raw "_1" "_2"
          If you look at the new raw file in LTSpice, the variables(nodes) have
          got new names. All variable(node) names from in1.raw are extended
          by _1 ,e.g. V(out_1), and all names from in2.raw are extended 
          by _2 ,e.g. V(out_2).
          Vector interpolation will be used, because -m is the same as -mv .

     Ltsputil.exe -m in1.raw in2.raw out.raw "" "_"
          The names of in1.raw are kept in the out.raw file, but we
          will get extended names for the variables of in2.raw, e.g. V(out_).

     Ltsputil.exe -ml in1.raw in2.raw out.raw "" "_"
          Same as above, but -ml forces linear interpolation in .AC analysis
          If no complex data is given, always linear interpolation is used

     Ltsputil.exe -moa in1.raw in2.raw out.raw "" "_"
          Option -ma forces ASCII output mode.



  N-Merge data of two raw files
  ----------------------------
  Merging two raw files allows a direct comparison of two totally different
  circuit simulations in one graphical output window. 
  It can be also used to add limit curves.
  The number of simulation steps in each file may be different.
  File size of the output file mainly depends on the number of simulation
  steps of the first file, because the program only calculates values
  for every time/frequency value in the first file. This helps to reduce
  the size of data files especially with .TRAN simulations.
  The NMerge-function uses either linear or vector interpolation to
  calculate data values in a fixed step size. Vector interpolation is used
  for complex data only(.AC analysis). It has no influence on real data 
  (.TRAN, .DC...). 
  Using a small minimum stepsize in the simulation greatly helps to reduce
  the interpolation errors. 
  I recommend to switch off compression in .TRAN simulation if you
  think of merging the generated raw files or if you want to equalize
  the time steps. The compression switch is in the control panel of 
  LTspiceIV/SwitcherCADIII.
  The raw file size can be reduced dramatically with the the .SAVE
  command in LTSpice.

  General usage:
   Ltsputil.exe -n[o][l|v][a|b] source1 source2 destination "ext1" "ext2"
          Option 'o'   : Overwrite an existing output file.
          Option 'l|v' : Use 'l'inear or 'v'ector interpolation.
                         If none of these two options is given,
                         vector interpolation will be used.
                         The 'v' option should be used for .AC analysis.
		  Option 'a'   : Output data format is ASCII.
		                 'b'inary is assumed as default if none is set.

  Example 1: 1001 points, add ""(=nothing) to the variable names
     Ltsputil.exe -n in1.raw in2.raw out.raw "_1" "_2"
          If you look at the new raw file in LTSpice, the variables(nodes) have
          got new names. All variable(node) names from in1.raw are extended
          by _1 ,e.g. V(out_1), and all names from in2.raw are extended 
          by _2 ,e.g. V(out_2).
          Vector interpolation will be used, because -m is the same as -mv .

     Ltsputil.exe -n in1.raw in2.raw out.raw "" "_"
          The names of in1.raw are kept in the out.raw file, but we
          will get extended names for the variables of in2.raw, e.g. V(out_).

     Ltsputil.exe -nl in1.raw in2.raw out.raw "" "_"
          Same as above, but -nl forces linear interpolation in .AC analysis
          If no complex data is given, always linear interpolation is used

     Ltsputil.exe -noa in1.raw in2.raw out.raw "" "_"
          Option -na forces ASCII output mode.

      [l|v] linear/vector interpolation, [z]ero x-axis offset
	  [a|b] ASCII or binary format of result file.



  Export data from raw file
  --------------------------
  This command retrieves the selected signals from a simulation raw file and
  stores it column formatted to a new file.
  This allows you to do any other post processing without knowing the raw file
  data format. You can also easily copy and paste these column based data
  to your favorite graphic, math or spread sheet program.
  Swept parameter simulations can be split into single runs stored in
  separate raw files or transposed to parallel columns.
  I would recommend switching off compression in .TRAN simulation if you
  think of merging the raw files generated or if you want to equalize
  the time steps. This hint is basically for .TRAN simulations only.
  The compression switch is in the control panel of LTspiceIV/SwitcherCADIII.

  Usage:
   Ltsputil.exe
      -x[o][s|t][nn][list] src dest varfmt delimfmt infofmt sig1 [sig2] ..

      Option 'o' : Overwrite an existing output file.
	  Option 's' : Write each sweep into a different file.
		           File name contains the sweep number
		           Example: out.plt -> out1.plt, out2.plt ...
		           Single swept output files have the greatest flexibility.
      Option 't' : A parameter swept raw file will be transposed to parallel
                   columns. This requires that all sweeps must have the same
                   number of x-axis steps. Thus all .TRAN raw files must be 
                   preprocessed(equalized) with "ltsputil -e".
                   Graphic programs give greater flexibilty with sweep data
                   organized in columns compared to sweep data in sequences.
      Option nn 
            none : The same as '1'.
             '0' : Only data values in output file.
             '1' : Additional #ASCII file info head lines in output file.
             '2' : Additional info line before each sweep run in output file.
             '3' : Option '1' + '2'.
             '4' : Additional automation info headlines with exactly the same
                   number of columns like the data rows. The info is in the
                   same order as in option '1'.
             '5' : Option '1' + '4' .
             '6' : Option '2' + '4' .
             '7' : Option '1' + '2' + '4' .
                   Options for easiest file import of swept files:
                     The most convenient options are 's' or 't' in most cases.
                     Other useful options are depending on the graphic program.
                     DPLOT 0,(1)  GNUPLOT 0,1,(2)  ORIGIN 0,(1),(2)
                     EXCEL, MATLAB, MATHCAD, SCILAB : 0 or 4
      list       : Optional 'i' for index followed by any combination of
                   'd|a|p|q|r|c' characters
                   Default is 'rc' for complex data if list is empty.
                   d=dB, a=abs, p=phase, q=phase +/-pi, r=real, c=complex,
      src        : name of the input raw file
      dest       : name of the output file
      varfmt     : C-syntax printf() format string for the data
                   Example: Floating point 7 digits resolution -> "%15.7e"
                   Always specify >=8 char. more as precision. 15 = 7 + 8
                   This ensures exact column format if option '4' is used.
      delimfmt   : C-syntax printf() format string for the column
                   delimiter, e.g "," for a ',' delimiter
      infofmt    : The info line starts with this string. It precedes each
                   sweep data set if option '2' is set.
                   Only an empty line is written if infofmt is empty "".
                   Examples: "#DATA" -> #DATA 2 201 4 3 , "" -> "" 
                   Structure of sweep info line if option '2': Nr = Number
infoFmt actSweepNr NrOfSweepSteps NrOfDataColumns totalNrOfSweeps transposeFlag

      sig1         The wildcard character * means extract all variables

  The character 'list' after x is necessary and useful for complex data
  only. It allows to select the type of output data: 'd'=dB, 'a'=abs, 'p'=
  total phase, 'q'=quadrant phase(+/-pi), 'r'=real or 'c'=complex value
  of the variables. You can freely choose any collection of data types. 
  The chosen data formats apply to all variables except the frequency axis.
  You can add an additional prefix 'i' to the 'list' to get an index from 0
  to the number of data points minus one. 

  Example: .TRAN simulation
    Ltsputil.exe -xo0 my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e"  "," "" *
          '0' Write only SPICE simulation data into the file.
          '*' Write all variables to the file.

  Example: .AC simulation
    Ltsputil.exe -xdp my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e"  " " "" 0 3 4 7"
         -xdp     : store d=dB and p=phase of all selected variables.
         "%14.6e" : eng. format with 6 digit behind decimal point.
         " "      : only one extra space after each column.
         ""       : No meaning as long as option '2' is not given in nn.
         0 3 4 7  : Select 0=frequency and variables with index 3 4 7.
                    These numbers are listed in the raw file.
                    You can also give exactly the name of the variables.
  Example: .AC simulation, with variable names
    Ltsputil.exe -xdp my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e" " " "" frequency V(out) V(in)

  Example: .AC simulation, with variable names
    Ltsputil.exe -xsdp my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e" " " "" frequency V(out) V(in)
         Option 's' commands a new output file for every x-axis sweep.
         Option nn assumed to be 3 if not given (see description above).

  Example: .AC simulation, with variable names
  Ltsputil.exe -xot1dp my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e" " " "" frequency V(out) V(in)
         Option 't' formats sweeps to columns for every x-axis sweep.
         Option '1' selects nn-mode 1. Plots signals in (d)B and (p)hase.

  Example: .TRAN simulation
    Ltsputil.exe -xo3 my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e"  "," "" 0 4 3
         "," Means comma delimiter between columns.
         'o' Overwrite existing output file.
         '3' Write info head lines and info line before each sweep data run.

  Example: .TRAN simulation
    Ltsputil.exe -xo4 my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e"  "," "" 0 4 3
          '4' Write automation info columns into the file.

  Example: .TRAN simulation
    Ltsputil.exe -xo0 my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e"  "," "" 0 4 3
          '0' Write only SPICE simulation data into the file.

  The 'i' option is less useful.
  Examples: with 'i' option
    Ltsputil.exe -xidp my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e"  " " "" 0 3 4 7
    Ltsputil.exe -xi my.raw plot.plt "%14.6e"  "" "" 0 4 3
         The index of each simulated step will be printed into the
         first column.


    Example: Spice raw file with 3 sweeps

  Conversion of tabulated data to binary/ASCII raw file file format.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  It converts and copies a text data file to either an ASCII-data file
  or a binary data file in raw format. The data can be then viewed
  with LTSPICE like a normal simulation result. The output file
  can be also used for further processing, e.g. for Merge or NMerge.
  Parameter sweepNo duplicates the data multiple times. This can
  be convenient for stepped parameter simulation, if you only need
  the same data for every sweep.
  An offset can be added to the x-axis numbers. This option is 
  required if negative time data is in the input file.
  The source file have to contain a standard raw file header
  followed by the data table. This table is then converted to
  the raw file format in the destination file. The header of the
  input file will become the header of the output raw-file.

  Usage
    Ltsputil.exe -t[o][a|b|][z] source dest [sweepNo] ..
          Option 'o'   : Overwrite an existing output file.
          Option 'a|b' : Output data format is 'a'SCII or 'b'inary.
                         If none of these two options is given,
                         output data format is binary.
          Option 'z'   : Add x-axis offset to x-axis, zero offset.
                         The value is in the header behind 'Offset:'
          sweepNo      : Number of sweeps with the same data
                         Default is 1 if no number is given


  Example
	Ltsputil.exe -toa limits.txt limits.raw 
	        Option -o overwrite, -a ASCII 


The input file must have the standard header of a raw-file starting
with the line 'Title ...' and ending with the line 'Values:'

The number behind 'Offset:' is used with the 'z'-option.
The data is in the lines following the line 'Values:'.
Data for generating .AC raw-files has to be in real,imag format.

Some examples of input files are below.
